## Poetry

For this revision, I decided to make the output more visually interesting. To do this, I studied the API for Termcolor, a python string library. While a simple change, this gave me the opportunity to learn a new library in python.

## Novel

For this revison, I decided to add page numbers and chapters. This change is also simple but makes the readability of the final project much smoother.
